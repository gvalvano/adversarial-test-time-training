## Notes:  

### Work in progress... Code will be available soon!

## Requirements
This code was implemented using TensorFlow 1.14 and the libraries detailed in [requirements.txt](https://github.com/gvalvano/multiscale-pyag/requirements.txt).
You can install these libraries as:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
or using conda (see [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51042589/conda-version-pip-install-r-requirements-txt-target-lib)).

We tested the code on a TITAN Xp GPU, and on a GeForce GTX 1080, using CUDA 10.2.
